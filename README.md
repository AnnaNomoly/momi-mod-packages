# Fields of Mistria Mod Packages
This repository is a collection of mod packages for my Fields of Mistria mods to be installed using the [Mods of Mistria Installer](https://github.com/Garethp/Mods-of-Mistria-Installer) (MOMI). Both mods that use Aurie/YYTK and mods that don't will have mod packages for installing them. 

## Mod Status (Non-YYTK Mods)
The table below will be updated with mod development to indicate the status of all Fields of Mistria mods I develop that don't use YYTK. For mods that *do* use YYTK, see my [fields-of-mistria-mods](https://github.com/AnnaNomoly/fields-of-mistria-mods) repository instead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is MOMI?
The [Mods of Mistria Installer](https://github.com/Garethp/Mods-of-Mistria-Installer) (MOMI) developed by [Gareth](https://github.com/Garethp) is a mod manager for Fields of Mistria. It is capable of installing and uninstalling mods developed for it. All of my Fields of Mistria mods are designed for MOMI, and will therefore have a corresponding mod package in this repository, regardless of whether the mod uses Aurie/YYTK or not.

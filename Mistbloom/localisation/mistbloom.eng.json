I'd like briefly introduce myself as the town doctor and fill you in on something concerning our small town.\n\nRecently a strange mist began plaguing our otherwise peaceful town at night. Shortly after it arrived I noticed an increase in patients visiting my clinic, all suffering from feelings of madness.\n\nJuniper and I have been hard at work trying to identify the cause. So far we've determined that proximity to monsters or lengthy exposure to the mist at night are the primary causes.\n\nWith Juniper's help I was able to create a potion to help temporarily stave off the onset madness. Unfortunately, it requires expensive ingredients that aren't native to Mistria.\n\nI've included some with this letter. If you need more please stop by my clinic and pick some up. But keep in mind that due to the cost of the ingredients I can't offer them for free.",
